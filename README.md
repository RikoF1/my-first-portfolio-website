# my-first-portfolio-website

Portfolio website that was part of an assignment for CM1101 - Computing Information Systems.
It mainly uses HTML and CSS.

It was designed with a blog style theme, everything hard coded and no use of any framework to help with design.

One of the requirements was to use an API, which due to constraints at the time, I decided to use one of Spotify's.
